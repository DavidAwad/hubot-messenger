# hubot-messenger-adapter
v 1.0.0

A hubot adapter for Facebook messenger! Right now it's not working though.

Set envvars `HUBOT_FB_USERNAME` and `HUBOT_FB_PASSWORD` to use this with an account.

Install `hubot`. Make sure to `npm install --save hubot-messenger` to add this module. 

Run the command `HUBOT_FB_USERNAME=<email> HUBOT_FB_PASSWORD=<pass> ./bin/hubot -a messenger` to run the bot from your local computer.
